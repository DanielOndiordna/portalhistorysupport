# Portal History Support
Ingress IITC plugin: Portal History Support for all IITC versions (with cache)

With this plugin the Portal History will be implemented into all versions of IITC. This plugin injects functionality from the IITC-CE TEST release (version 0.31.1.20210225.132054) plus extra modifications into all IITC versions (IITC.me 0.26 / IITC-CE 0.31.1). Code will be injected into the IITC core. History results are cached and re-used automatically. Details from your COMMS captured portals are loaded automatically.
